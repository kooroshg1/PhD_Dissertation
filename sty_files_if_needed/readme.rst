Style Files
-------------

This is about the worst place you could get the style files from. It's only included as a quick fix for an incomplete installation of ``LaTeX`` and necessary style files. The best approach is to install these packages per the method described by your TeX disttribution. `MikTeX <miktex.org>`_ automates this for Windows users, `MacTeX <https://www.tug.org/mactex/>`_ includes the ``TeX Live Utility`` for installation for Mac users, and `TeXLive <https://www.tug.org/texlive/>`_ on Linux should use ``tlmgr``. If that doesn't work, you may consider putting the necessary ``.sty`` file from here into the directory with your thesis.
