\chapter{Design Sensitivity Analysis}\label{ch:sensitivityAnalysis}
In this chapter, the concept behind discrete and continuum sensitivity formulation is discussed and the general approach for deriving the sensitivity equations is presented. The difference between local and total formulation of the sensitivity response is discussed and finally the independence of continuum sensitivity formulations to discretization method is proven. This enables us to reuse the solver of governing equations to calculate the sensitivity response. This is typically not possible for discrete sensitivity formulation. The two sensitivity analysis techniques are applied to a heat transfer benchmark problem where the sensitivity of response to the shape of the domain is calculated. This problem is also used in the next chapter for implementation of different immersed boundary methods.

\section{General Formulation}
The general shape for the computational domain is defined in Figure \ref{fig:C2_continuumDomain}. The response variable on this domain can represent a fluid, i.e. pressure or velocity, or can be calculated for a solid, i.e. displacements. Nevertheless, in any of these cases the response is calculated by solving a governing equation subject to boundary conditions. 

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=4.00cm]{Chapter_2/figure/general_domain.png}
	\caption{General computational domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\Gamma$.}
	\label{fig:C2_continuumDomain}
\end{figure}

In this work, the governing equation and the boundary conditions are represented in the functional form as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C2_governingEquationAndBC}.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C2_governingEquationAndBC}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_generalGoverningEquation}
	\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{u}, t; \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, t; \mathbf{b})
	\quad \text{on} \quad \Omega
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_generalBoundaryCondition}
	\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{u}, t; \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x}, t; \mathbf{b})	
	\quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

where $\mathbf{A}$ is the governing equation such as Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid or elastic equations for the solid domain and $\mathbf{B}$ is the boundary condition. $\mathbf{u}$ is the response variable such as displacement or pressure. $t$ is time, $\mathbf{b}$ is the design variable such as shape or size, and $\mathbf{x}$ is the spatial coordinate. $\mathbf{f}$ and $\mathbf{g}$ are the values of governing equation and boundary conditions. It should be noted that in this formulation, the functions $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are only implicitly dependent on the design variable $\mathbf{b}$. This is important when deriving the sensitivity equations later in this chapter. This implicit dependence is represented by using the semicolon symbol in the definition of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

For the general case of problem formulation, the total sensitivity of response variable, $\mathbf{u}$, with respect to the $i$-th design variable, $b_i$, is written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_totalSensitivityDef}
	\frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D b_i} = 
	\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial b_i}}_\text{local derivative} + 
	\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \cdot
	\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial b_i}}_\text{convective term}
\end{equation}

The total derivative is known as material derivative in continuum mechanics \cite{mase2009continuum}. This total sensitivity defines the change of response variable, $\mathbf{u}$, with respect to design variable and space dependent changes. The material derivative consists of the local derivative, $\partial \mathbf{u}/\partial b_i$, plus the convective term, $\partial \mathbf{u}/\partial \mathbf{x} \cdot \partial \mathbf{x}/\partial b_i$. The local derivative is the measure of change in the response variable due to change in the design parameter. Whereas, the convective term accounts for the movement of points in space due to change in the design variable. This is specially applicable to shape sensitivity analysis where the change in design variable, will clearly cause the material points to move \cite{cross2014local}.

The convective term consists of two separate gradients: i) $\partial \mathbf{u} / \partial \mathbf{x}$ which represents the spatial gradient of the response variable, and ii) $\partial \mathbf{x} / \partial b_i$ that defines the sensitivity of the location of computational nodes with respect to changes in the design variable. The response gradient, $\partial u/\partial x$, is calculated from the analysis results, using finite difference approach or derivative of shape functions in FEA formulation. Calculation of domain sensitivity, $\partial \mathbf{x} / \partial b_i$, requires more attention.

A common approach for calculating the domain sensitivity, is to use the techniques used to deform the body-conformal mesh in CFD/FEA simulations. These methods are usually based on representing the computational grid as a system of springs that connected to each other at the nodes. This system is modeled and solved using structural analysis techniques, where the sensitivities can be easily implemented. This is effectively a shape sensitivity analysis for the structural problem \cite{haftka1986structural}. This step is removed from the analysis if the computational domain is not affected by the design variable since $\partial x/\partial b$ is equal to zero \cite{gobal2014continuum}. This is one of the reasons to use the immersed boundary calculation since it reduces the cost of the simulation. This is discussed in more details in Chapter \ref{ch:immersedBoundary}.

\section{Benchmark Cases}
To compare the discrete and continuum sensitivity analysis formulations, two problems from different disciplines are selected. As a simplified representation for the fluid/thermal systems, the one-dimensional heat transfer analysis in a beam is selected. This problem is used by different researchers for investigating sensitivity analysis for nonlinear systems \cite{dowding2001sensitivity} and thermal design and monitoring \cite{szopa2005second, sorli2004computational}. The special interest in this problem is due to availability of analytical solution since this can be used to verify the numerical results of the sensitivity analysis. For the solid mechanics problem, a finite element model of an axial bar with distributed load is selected \cite{szabo1991finite}. This problem is used by different researchers as a demonstration case for sensitivity analysis \cite{cross2014local, wickert2009least}. These benchmark cases are explained in more details in the following sections.

\subsection{Heat transfer benchmark case}
The temperature in the one dimensional domain is governed by the Laplace equation as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C2_laplaceEquation}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_transientHeatEquation}
	\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

where $T$ is the temperature, $x$ is spatial variable, $t$ is time, and $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. For this problem we are only interested in the steady state solution of the system, therefore the right-hand-side of Equation \eqref{eq:C2_transientHeatEquation} is equal to zero. Therefore, the governing equation for this problem is written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_laplaceEquation}
	\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} = 0
\end{equation}

The boundary conditions are defined as constant temperatures at the two ends of the domain as $T_0$ and $T_L$. The length of domain is selected as $L$. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C2_benchmarkCase}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14.00cm]{Chapter_2/figure/benchmark_case.png}
	\caption{One dimensional domain with heat conduction.}
	\label{fig:C2_benchmarkCase}
\end{figure}

The analytical solution for this problem is available and is written as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C2_benchmarkCaseAnalyticalSolution}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_benchmarkCaseAnalyticalSolution}
	T = \frac{T_L - T_0}{L} x + T_0
\end{equation}

The analytical sensitivity of the temperature with respect to beam's length is calculated by differentiating Equation \eqref{eq:C2_benchmarkCaseAnalyticalSolution} with respect to $L$.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial T}{\partial L} = -\frac{T_L - T_0}{L^2} x
\end{equation}

This is later used for verifying the discrete and continuous sensitivity results.

\subsection{Solid mechanics benchmark case}\label{section:C2_solid_mechanics_benchmark}
The axial bar is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C2_axialBarPhysicalShape}. The length of the bar is selected as $L = 1$ with axial stiffness of $EA = 1$. The distributed load is selected as a sine wave, $F_d(x) = sin(\pi x/L)$, with an extra axial load at the end, $F_p = 1 / \pi$. The beam is fixed using a spring of stiffness, $k = 10$, at $x = L$.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14.00cm]{Chapter_2/figure/solid_mechanics_benchmark.png}
	\caption{Axial bar under distributed loading.}
	\label{fig:C2_axialBarPhysicalShape}
\end{figure}

The governing equation for the displacement of the axial bar and its corresponding boundary conditions are defined as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C2_axialBarGEandBC}. The length of the bar is selected as the design variable therefore, it is included explicitly in the governing equation and boundary condition definitions.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_axialBarGE}
	\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{L} x \right) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_axialBarBC}
	\begin{cases}
	\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x = 0} = \dfrac{1}{\pi} \\
	\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x = L} = -10 u(L)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}\label{eq:C2_axialBarGEandBC}

For this problem, the analytical solution is written as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C2_axialBarSolution}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_axialBarSolution}
	u(x; L) = 
	\frac{L^2}{\pi^2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{L} \right) + 
	\frac{2L + 10(L - 1)(L - x) - 1}{10 \pi}
\end{equation}

The displacement equation of \eqref{eq:C2_axialBarSolution} is differentiated to calculate the sensitivity of displacement to the length of the bar. The sensitivity equation \eqref{eq:C2_axialBarSensitivitySolution} is later used to verify the results of continuum and discrete sensitivity formulations.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C2_axialBarSensitivitySolution}
	\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial L} = 
	\dfrac{2L}{\pi^2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{L} \right) - 
	\dfrac{x}{\pi} \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{L} \right) + 
	\dfrac{10L - 5x - 4}{5 \pi}
\end{equation}

\section{Summary}
In summary, we looked at two main approaches used to calculate the sensitivity response of a system. The discrete method is based on differentiating the discretized governing equations whereas in continuum method the governing equation are differentiated first and then discretized. We applied these techniques to a simple 1-D heat transfer problem and calculated the sensitivity of response to shape design parameter. The sensitivities are calculated in the local form for each of these methods and compared with the analytical results where they show good comparison. It is showed that by using the continuum sensitivity analysis, the differential operators used in the solution of governing equations are reused in the sensitivity analysis. This effectively means that the black-box solver used in the simulation step can be reused with new boundary conditions for solving the sensitivity response. As showed in the example problem, this is not possible when using discrete method. This is mainly due to the fact that the discrete operators will be affected by differentiating the discretized governing equations with respect to design variables. Therefore, more details about the analysis needs to be known when using discrete approach compared to the continuum. Continuum sensitivity approach is used in this research due to its ability to treat the analysis as black-box for solving both the governing equations and the sensitivity response. However, the result of sensitivity analysis is still the local sensitivities which needs to be transformed to the total form using the chain rule. This is not favourable because it is another step on top of an already expensive analysis. We are proposing to use a non-body conformal approach such as immersed boundary method for analysis to remove this step from the sensitivity calculation.
