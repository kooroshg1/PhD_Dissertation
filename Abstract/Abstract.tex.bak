In this paper, a robust continuum sensitivity formulation for the shape sensitivity analysis of weakly coupled aero-structural systems is derived. In this method, the solid boundaries are modelled using the immersed boundary approach. This simplifies the grid generation for the complex and deforming geometries since the computational mesh does not need to conform to the boundaries. The sensitivity analysis consists of differentiating the continuum form of the governing equations where the effect of the solid boundaries are modelled as additional forcing terms in these equations.  By differentiating the governing equations, it is possible to reuse the operators utilized for solving the governing equations. Therefore, there is no need to develop new solvers for the solution of sensitivity response. This methodology is applied to different demonstration problems including flow over a cylinder and a simplified aeroelastic model of a wing. The wing structure is modelled as a beam with the lifting surface mounted at the tip where the load is transfered to the structure through the mounting point. The sensitivity results with this approach compares well with the complex step method results. Moreover, it is shown that the methodology is capable of handing complex shapes with high Reynolds numbers.
