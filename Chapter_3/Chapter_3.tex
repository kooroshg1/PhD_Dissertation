\chapter{Immersed Boundary Method}\label{ch:immersedBoundary}
Immersed boundary methods are class of techniques in computational fluid dynamics where the governing equations are solved on cartesian grid that does not conform to the shape of the body in the flow. This is opposed to well known body-conformal techniques where the computational mesh accurately represents the shape of the domain. The boundary condition on the immersed surfaces are not applied explicitly, instead an extra forcing function is added to the governing equations or the discrete numerical scheme is updated near the boundary. The immersed boundary technique is in special interest to us since it removes the mesh sensitivity calculation from the analysis. In this chapter we talk about different classes of immersed boundary technique and apply them to a simple problem. The applicability of these methods in the continuum sensitivity analysis is also discussed. At the end of this chapter, we will chose couple of immersed boundary techniques for sensitivity analysis implementation.

\section{Introduction}
When people started to use computational models in the design of systems, it was usually sufficient to include single physics into the design. The simulations were usually based on structural solvers using finite elements analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The new requirements such as higher fuel efficiency, improved controllability, higher stiffness to mass ratios and lower radar signature have forced the designers to develop more unconventional configurations. For example, one way to reduce the infra-red signature of the aircraft, is to remove the engines from underneath the wings and put them inside the aircraft. However, by doing this a massive heat source will be added to the structure. The thermal expansion due to this excessive heat load needs to be incorporated into the structural analysis of the system. This requires a multidisciplinary analysis combining thermal analysis for heat transfer and structural analysis for thermal expansion and other structural loads \cite{deaton2013stiffening}. However, this has not been a traditional design method. Only recently people have started to look into such configurations.

The multidisciplinary analysis is required for many engineering application however the one that is used the most is the interaction of fluid and a deformable structure. This is commonly known as a Fluid-Solid Interaction (FSI) problem. FSI problems are dealt with in many different engineering applications, such as fluttering and buffeting of bridges \cite{jain1996coupled}, vibration of wind turbine blades \cite{arrigan2011control}, and aeroelastic response of airplanes \cite{farhat2006provably}. FSI problems are also seen in blood flows in arteries and artificial heart valves \cite{sotiropoulos2009review}, flying and swimming \cite{kern2006simulations}. The conventional approach for simulating such problems is the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. ALE methods are based on body- conforming grids to track the location of the fluid-structure interface. ALE methods have been applied to many FSI problems however, they are cumbersome if not impossible to apply to FSI problems with large deformations for complicated boundary shapes.

Immersed boundary (IB) methods are considered a separate family of methods used for modelling FSI problems with complicated boundary shapes and large deformations. IB methods, are based on solving the governing equations for fluids on a fixed grid. Although this computational grid can be structured (Cartesian) or unstructured, most methods are based on structured grid because of the simplicity of grid generation. Moreover, when using structured grid, extremely efficient computational methods can be utilized on to solve the governing equations. In IB approach, the fluid-structure boundaries are represented by a set of independent nodes. The solid boundary effect on the flow is formulated either by introducing fictitious body forces in the governing equations or by locally modifying the structure of the background grid.

IB has several advantages over the ALE technique. Probably the biggest advantage is the simplification of the task of grid generation. Generating body-conformal grid for a complex shape is usually very complicated. The objective is to construct a grid that provides adequate local resolution with the minimum number of total grid points.  This requires a significant input from the user and is an iterative process. For complicated boundaries the unstructured grid approach is better suited however the grid quality is reduced for extremely complicated geometry. In contrast, for a simulation carried using an IB method, grid complexity and quality are not affected by the complexity of the geometry. 

This advantage becomes even more evident for flows with moving boundaries. The ALE approach requires generating a new mesh or deforming the old mesh to match the new boundary shape at each time step. The solution from last time step is also required to be projected to this new computational mesh. Both of the deformation/projection can affect the accuracy, robustness and the computational cost associated the the simulation. On the other hand, the boundary motion in IB method can be handled with rather ease because the computational mesh does not depend on the shape of the boundary. Therefore, although a significant progress in simulating flows using ALE methods has been made in the recent years \cite{lomtev1999discontinuous, farhat2004cfd, cheng2005fluid}, the IB method still remains an attractive alternative for such problems due to its simplicity and cost.

In the following sections of this chapter we first look at the governing equations for the fluid and solid domain. Followed by this different approaches for modelling the follow using IB method are discussed in detail. We apply different IB techniques to a simplified problem to compare the efficiency and simplicity of implimentation. The results are compared with body-conformal solution approach for accuracy comparison. Finally we assess different IB methods with regards to their applicability of the Continuum Sensitivity Analysis (CSA) framework.

\section{Governing Equations}
In the fluid region $\Omega_f$, the governing equations for incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid are known as Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. In the compact indicial notation, the NS equations are written as

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C3_GE}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_continuity}
	\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i} = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_momentum}
	\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial u_i u_j}{\partial x_j} = 
	-\frac{1}{\rho_f	} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} + 
	\nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} \right) + 
	f_i
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

where the repeated indices imply summation and $i,j=1,2,3$. $x_i$ are the spatial coordinates, $u_i$ are the velocity components of the fluid in $i$ direction, $\rho_f$ is the fluids density, $p$ is the pressure, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $f_i$ are body forces. These forces are used in the IB technique to represent the effect of immersed boundaries on the fluid. In general purpose CFD solvers, due to the use of unstructured grid to represent the shape, it is usually required to use mappings (Jacobian) to convert the physical coordinate to a computational coordinate. This will become problematic when we have skewed elements which cause the mapping to become singular. This step is removed in the IB approach since the governing equations \eqref{eq:C3_GE} are discretized on a Cartesian  grid.

The solid domain is modelled using a linear elastic theory in this work. The governing equations are written as

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C3_linearEalsticityEquations}
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{ji,j} + F_i = \rho_s \partial_{tt} u_i
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( u_{j,i} + u_{i,j} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

where $\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\epsilon$ is the strain tensor, $u$ is the displacement vector, $C$ is stiffness tensor, $F$ is the body force, and $\rho_s$ is the mass density of solid. These governing equations are solved to track the motion of the solid boundary. 

To solve the coupled system of equations of \eqref{eq:C3_GE} and \eqref{eq:C3_linearEalsticityEquations}, we need to have boundary conditions. The boundary conditions of \eqref{eq:C3_GE} are defined as pressure or velocity magnitudes on the outer boundaries of the domain. After solving Equation \eqref{eq:C3_GE}, the loads on the structure are calculated by integrating the fluid pressure from over the solid boundaries. This will be the boundary load used for solving Equation \eqref{eq:C3_linearEalsticityEquations}. When the governing equations for the solid region is solved, the displacements of the solid domain are known. This is fed into the CFD solver to update the solid boundary location for fluid domain. This will change the solution of fluid's solver resulting in different pressure distributions. This process is repeated until a convergence is satisfied. The convergence can be defined as a change in the structural deflection for two subsequent steps in a static problem.

\section{Benchmark Case}\label{sec:C3_benchmark_case}
We define a 1D benchmark problem to investigate different IB formulations in detail. In one dimensional space the equations of incompressible flow are not challenging and also it is not simple to write a one-dimensional analogue of the IB to capture all of its features. However, for a simpler one dimensional problem it is easier to understand different formulations of IB method and later apply IB to higher dimensions. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is better understood. The other reason for working with a simplified model is the availability of analytical results that can be used for verifying the results we get from the numerical solvers. As the final note, for this benchmark case we mainly focused on the fluid domain, the structural behaviour can be easily added to this formulation.

To derive the one dimensional benchmark case we start with the Navier-Stokes equations. Consider a viscous incompressible fluid in the channel $0 \geq y \leq 1$, $-\infty < x < \infty$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_benchmarkCase}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14.00cm]{Chapter_3/figure/C3_infinite_channel.png}
	\caption{1D benchmark case for IB method.}
	\label{fig:C3_benchmarkCase}
\end{figure}

We can also assume that the boundary conditions are periodic in $x$. Assume that there is a horizontal plate running through the length of this channel at $y=y_0$ and moving with $u_0$ velocity in horizontal direction. We assume no-slip condition where the fluid and the plate meet. This will force the fluid to accelerate in $x$ direction due to the viscous stress from the moving plate. We expect no motion in $y$ direction and drops all terms in the NS equations containing $u_j$ velocity. Due to the continuity equation \eqref{eq:C3_continuity}, there is no variation in $x$ direction so we can drop all the terms that involve with $x$ variation as well. This enables us to simplify the NS equation of \eqref{eq:C3_momentum} to Equation \eqref{eq:C3_benchmarkProblem}. It should be noted that the continuum equation \eqref{eq:C3_continuity} is automatically satisfied.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C3_benchmarkProblem}
\begin{equation}
	u_t = \mu u_{yy} \quad \text{in } \Omega_f
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
	u = u_0 \quad \text{at } y = 1 \\
	u = 0 \quad \text{at } y = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Equation \eqref{eq:C3_benchmarkProblem} is transient in nature however, its steady state solution can be calculated by setting the time derivative in Equation \eqref{eq:C3_benchmarkProblem} equal to zero. This equation is commonly known as Couette flow in fluid dynamics. The analytical solution for this equation is shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C3_benchmarkAnalyticalSolution}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_benchmarkAnalyticalSolution}
	u = u_0 x
\end{equation}

We will use this analytical solution to verify the results of different IB methods defined in the following sections.

\section{Immersed Boundary Classification}
In general, IB methods can be classified in three main families: i) discrete forcing, ii) continuum forcing, and iii) cut-cell methods. This classification is based on how the interface conditions are handled in the IB algorithm. In this section we present the essence of each method and try to point out their primary advantages and disadvantages. In general, the immersed boundary approach is based on modifying the NS equations for imposing the boundary conditions and leads to one of the three categories.

\section{Application in Continuum Sensitivity Analysis}
While considerable effort of research and development went in different techniques for modelling the flow using immersed boundary method, very few efforts were directed to calculating the sensitivity of flow with respect to change in the shape of the immersed boundary.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, there are different approaches for calculating the sensitivity response of a system. Among these method, the discrete and continuum analytical sensitivity calculation techniques are more desired due to their accuracy and cost compared to numerical method. However, the continuum sensitivity analysis method enables us to use a single black-box solver for the solution of both governing equation and sensitivity response. Due to this superiority, continuum sensitivity analysis is chosen as the sensitivity analysis technique. As the results, immersed boundary method of choice need to conform to the requirements of the sensitivity analysis. As mentioned in previous chapter, continuum sensitivity equations are derived by differentiating the continuous governing equations. Only the IB methods with continuum forcing approaches have the boundary formulation in their continuous formulation. Therefore, continuous IB is used. The discrete immersed boundary method can also be utilized if discrete sensitivity analysis is chosen however, we do not investigate those techniques in this work. This is investigated in the works of \cite{kreissl2011explicit, borrvall2003topology, challis2009level}, where they used the penalization technique alongside with discrete sensitivity analysis method to calculate the sensitivity of flow to boundary shape changes. These works are mainly focused on stokes flow where the Reynolds number is relatively small.

The continuum sensitivity analysis, requires the governing equations be continuously differentiable. However, the delta functions used for in classical IB and virtual boundary method do not satisfy this condition. The Heaviside function used in the penalization technique also does not satisfy this condition since in many case a discrete step function is used to assign the force terms. This discontinuity needs to be addressed when using the CSA to calculated the sensitivities. This is achieved by introducing new regularized delta function and using regularized Heaviside functions to assign force terms to computational nodes. This is investigated in more details in the next Chapter.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter we investigated different immersed boundary techniques in detail and compared them in terms of accuracy and ease of implementation. The discrete immersed boundary techniques are more general and do not require user defined parameters to represent the immersed boundaries. However, they cannot implemented without a through knowledge of discretization technique used for the governing equations. Moreover, the implementation of interpolation function used for force calculation for discrete IB can become extremely complicated for complex 3D boundaries. On the other hand, the continuum immersed boundary technique is straight forward and can be easily implemented without a deep understanding of discretization and solution technique since the immersed boundary is handled in the continuum form of the equations. Using the continuum immersed boundary technique it is possible to reach to the same accuracy as the discrete method with the aid of tuning parameters. Most importantly, the continuum sensitivity analysis can be used in conjunction with continuum sensitivity analysis. This enables us to use same solver for both solving the governing equations and the sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the continuum immersed boundary is used to deriving the sensitivity response of coupled aero-structural system. The current bottle neck to do the sensitivity analysis using continuum immersed boundary method, is the discontinuous mapping functions that are using to assign the forcing terms to mesh cells. This needs to be done in a continuum fashion so that continuum sensitivity analysis can be used.
