\section{Continuum Forcing Method}
In this implementation of the immersed boundary, a forcing equation is added to the continuous governing equation \eqref{eq:C3_momentum} to represent the effect of the boundary. The continuous IB technique is the original method developed by Peskin \cite{peskin1972flow} for coupled simulation of blood flow due to the contraction of heart muscle. In this approach, the immersed boundary is represented by a set of elastic fibers that their locations are tracked in a Lagrangian fashion by a collection of massless points. These points move with the local fluid velocity. Therefore, the location of the $k$-th Lagrangian point, $X_k$ is governed by the following equation

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial X_k}{\partial t} = u(X_k, t)
\end{equation}

where $u$ is the velocity of the fluid at location $X_k$. The location of fluid nodes, $x$, does not necessary coincide with the location of the Lagrangian points. Thus, it is required to map the velocities from the Eulerian domain, where the fluid's equation of motion are solved, to Lagrangian nodes. In a purely continuum problem, this can be done using the Dirac delta functions. The property of the Dirac delta function that enables the mapping between the Euler and Lagrangian domain is shown in the following equation

\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Omega_f} f(x) \delta(x - X_k) = f(X_k)
\end{equation}

As can be seen here, by convoluting the function of interest and the delta function, we can evaluate our function of interest at any location where the delta function is defined. By defining the delta function at $X_k$ and using velocity from CFD solver as function $f$, we can evaluate the needed velocity for IB at any arbitrary point $X_k$. Although this is the main idea of mapping data to Lagrangian domain, this approach becomes unstable in practice \cite{lee2003stability}. In the practical implementation of immersed boundary method, the effect of delta function need to be expanded to couple of nodes around $X_k$. This is achieved by relaxing the delta function. The relaxed delta function is generally refereed to as regularized delta function \cite{shin2008assessment}. The regularized delta function is defined using Equation \eqref{eq:C3_regularizedDeltaFunction} in three dimensions.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_regularizedDeltaFunction}
	\delta_h(x_1, x_2, x_3) = \frac{1}{dx_1 \cdot dx_2 \cdot dx_3}
							   \phi \left( \frac{x_1 - \eta_1}{dx_1} \right)
							   \phi \left( \frac{x_2 - \eta_2}{dx_2} \right)
							   \phi \left( \frac{x_2 - \eta_3}{dx_3} \right)
\end{equation}

where $x_i$ is the spatial coordinate in each direction, $\eta_i$ is the location where the delta function is defined, and $dx_i$ is the grid size in each direction. In above equation $i$ can be $1$, $2$, or $3$. The $\phi$ function is defined in Equation \eqref{eq:C3_phiFunction}. As shown here there are different ways of defining this function. The input of $\phi$ function is $r$ which is defined as $(x_i - \eta_i) / dx_i$.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C3_phiFunction}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_phiFunction_2point}
	\phi(r) = 
	\begin{cases}
	1 - |r| \quad &|r| \leq 1 \\
	0	\quad &\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_phiFunction_3point}
	\phi(r) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + \sqrt{-3r^2 + 1} \right) \quad &|r| \leq 0.5 \\
		\frac{1}{6} \left( 5 - 3|r| - \sqrt{-3(1 - |r|)^2 + 1} \right) & 0.5 \geq |r| \leq 1.5 \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_phiFunction_4point}
	\phi(r) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{1}{8}
		\left(
		3 - 2|r| + \sqrt{1 + 4|r| - 4r^2}
		\right) \quad &0 \leq |r| \leq 1
		\\
		\frac{1}{8}
		\left(
		5 - 2|r| + \sqrt{-7 + 12|r| - 4r^2}
		\right) \quad &1 \leq |r| \leq 2
		\\
		0 &\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_phiFunction_6point}
	\phi(r) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\begin{split}
		\frac{61}{112} - \frac{11}{42} |r| - \frac{11}{56} |r|^2 + \frac{1}{12} |r|^3 + 
		\frac{\sqrt{3}}{336}
		\left( 243 + 1584 |r| \right. \\
		\left. - 748 |r|^2 - 1560 |r|^3 + 500 |r|^4 + 336 |r|^5 - 112 |r|^6
		\right)^{1/2}
		\end{split} \quad & 0 \leq |r| \leq 1
		\\
		\frac{21}{16} + \frac{7}{12} |r| - \frac{7}{8} |r|^2 + \frac{1}{6} |r|^3 -

		\frac{1}{2} \phi \left( |r| - 2 \right) & 2 \leq |r| \leq 3
		\\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Equation \eqref{eq:C3_phiFunction_2point} is the 2-point delta function that does the linear interpolation between the points point \cite{saiki1996numerical}. Equation \eqref{eq:C3_phiFunction_3point} shoes the 3-point delta function used by Roma et al. \cite{roma1999adaptive}, and Equation \eqref{eq:C3_phiFunction_4point} and \eqref{eq:C3_phiFunction_6point} are 4-point and 6-point delta functions used by Peskin \cite{peskin2002immersed}. The comparison between the shape of different $\phi(r)$ functions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_phi_function}

\end{figure}

Now we can write the mapping from the Eulerian nodes of the fluid solver to Lagrangian nodes as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C3_lagrange2euler}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_lagrange2euler}
	u(X_k) = \int_\Omega u(x) \delta(x - X_k) dx
\end{equation}

where $\Omega$ is the computational domain, $u(x)$ is the velocity at the Eulerian nodes, $x$ is the coordinate of the Eulerian nodes, $u(X_k)$ is the velocity at the desired Lagrangian node, and $X_k$ is the coordinate of the Lagrangian node. Most of the continuum forcing approaches are the same upto this point. They diverge depending of the way they calculate the forcing terms.

\subsection{Classical IB method}
In the classical IB method, the forces at the immersed boundaries are calculate using appropriate constitutive laws, i.e. Hooks law. This can be expressed as follows.

\begin{equation}
	f(X_k) = \mathcal{M}(X_k)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{M}$ is an operator which describes the properties of the boundaries. This force is calculated at the Lagrangian points and need to be transferred back to the Eulerian nodes. This is done using the same delta functions used previously to map the Eulerian results to Lagrangian. This method is well suited for a case of elastic bodies but will break for the cases of rigid boundaries or when the rigidity of boundaries are much more than the fluid. The origin of this problem is due to the high cycle oscillations that occur near the boundaries.

This approach is applied to the demonstration problem defined in Section \ref{sec:C3_benchmark_case}. We modelled the location of the fixed boundary using the classical IB method and verified the results using analytical formulas for this problem. The forcing function is added to the right-hand-side of the governing equation as follows

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} - f(t)
\end{equation}

where $f(t)$ is the forcing function using to model the boundary. This equation is discretized using the Cranck-Nicholson method as follows

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_discretizedEquationPeskinIB}
	u^{n+1} = u^{n} + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \left( \frac{\partial^2 u^{n+1}}{\partial x^2} + 
	                                            \frac{\partial^2 u^n}{\partial x^2}\right) - \Delta t f^n 
\end{equation}

The steps to solve this equation and model the stationary wall using the IB method are as follows

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define the initial condition as $u^0$ and set $f^0$ equal to zero.
	\item Calculate the velocity at the next time step, $u^1$, using Equation \eqref{eq:C3_discretizedEquationPeskinIB}
	\item Based on the new velocity at $t=1$ calculate the velocity at the location where the stationary wall is supposed to be, $X$, using $\delta$ function ($U$).
	\item Calculate the distance that this node will move in the current time step: $X^{n+1} = X^n + U \Delta t$
	\item Based on the new location of the node, calculate the forces as: $F = K \left( X^{n+1} - X^0 \right)$, where $X^0$ is the desired location of the wall and $K$ is the stiffness of wall. 
	\item Map the force at the Lagrangian location $X$ to its neighbouring Eulerian points using $\delta$ function.
	\item Reiterate until the convergence is satisfied.
\end{enumerate}

For the classical IB method, we investigated the accuracy of the results to the number of nodes, wall velocity, and the stiffness used to model the wall. The immersed boundary simulation is compared with analytical solution of this problem. We chose the normalized root mean square error to compared the analytical and IB results. This is defined as follows.

\begin{equation*}
	NRMSE = \dfrac{\sqrt{\dfrac{\sum_{n=1}{N} \left( \hat{y}_n - y \right)^2}{n}}}{y_{max} - y_{min}}
\end{equation*}

where $\hat{y}_t$ is the predicted value, $y$ is the true value, and $n$ is the number data points. Normalizing by $y_{max} - y_{min}$ enables us to compare models with different scales. This is especially useful when compared the results for different wall velocities.

For the first investigation, we selected the wall stiffness as $10^2$ and its location is selected as $x_{wall} = 0.51885$. We chose this location so that it does not coincide with the location of computational nodes. The time step is chosen as $10^{-5}$ and the wall velocity is fixed at $1 m/s$. For this simulation we used both 2-point and 4-point delta functions to transfer results between Lagrangian and Eulerian nodes. The computation domain is discretized using $11$, $41$, $81$, and $161$ nodes. The results of IB method is verified with analytical results.

\label{table:C3_classicalIBResultNodeNumberRMSE}
\end{table}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_classicalIBResultNodeNumber} and Table \ref{table:C3_classicalIBResultNodeNumberRMSE}, by increasing the number of nodes, the error in IB result decreases. However, changing the delta function from 2-point to 4-point does not effect the accuracy of the solution significantly. The higher order delta function can also decreases the accuracy of the solution for very low number of nodes (here 11). 

For the second investigation, we looked at the effect of changing the moving wall velocity on the solution accuracy. For this simulation, we fixed the number of nodes to 81 and set the stiffness value to $10^2$. The wall location is fixed at $0.51885$. The time step is also chosen as $10^{-5}$. For this problem, we only focused on 2-point delta function. We chose the wall velocity as $10$, $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4$. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_classicalIBResultWallVelocity} and Table \ref{fig:C3_classicalIBResultWallVelocityRMSE}, the method is capable of handling flow with different velocity without a loss in accuracy of the results. However, the simulation time increases with increase in wall velocity.

For the last case study of classical IB method, we looked at the effect of the wall stiffness on the accuracy of the solution. For this case, we fixed the wall location at $x_{wall} = 0.51885$ and defined the wall velocity as $10 m/s$. The time step is selected as $10^{-5}$. We looked at the wall stiffness of $0.1$, $1$, $10$, and $100$. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_classicalIBResultWallStiffness} and Table \ref{table:C3_classicalIBResultWallStiffnessRMSE}, wall stiffness has a considerable effect of the solution result. Therefore, a convergence study for the wall stiffness value is usually required if one wants to model the stiff boundaries.

\subsection{Virtual boundary method}
The virtual boundary method is a different approach for imposing the effect of immersed boundary through force terms. This approach is well suited for both the rigid and elastic boundaries. The difference between this approach and the classical IB method is that it does not require the solution of the constitutive equations to calculate the force terms. This approach is based on the works of the works of Goldstein et al. \cite{goldstein1993modeling} to simulate the flow around the rigid bodies. The forcing term in the virtual boundary method is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_virtualBoundaryMethod}
	F(X_k, t) = 
	\alpha \int_0^t \left[ u(X_k, t) - U(X_k, t) \right] dt + 
	\beta \left[ u(X_k, t) - U(X_k, t) \right]
\end{equation}

where $F$ is the required force at the $k$-th Lagrangian point, $u(X_k, t)$ is the velocity calculated from the the Eulerian nodes using the $\delta$ function, and $U(X_k)$ is the desired velocity at the Lagrangian point $X_k$. The coefficient $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are selected to best enforce the boundary condition at the immersed solid boundary. Equation \eqref{eq:C3_virtualBoundaryMethod} is essentially a way to provide a feedback control to the system to make sure that the desired velocity ($U(X_k, t)$) is achieved at the immersed boundary. From a physical stand point, this equation represents a damped oscillator \cite{iaccarino2003immersed}.

As before, we apply this technique to the demonstration problem defined in Section \ref{sec:C3_benchmark_case}. We use the Crank-Nicholson method to discretize the equations as shown in the following equation. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_virtualBoundaryDiscretization}
	\frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\Delta t} = 
	\frac{1}{2}
	\left(
	\frac{\partial^2 u^{n+1}}{\partial x^2} +
	\frac{\partial^2 u^{n}}{\partial x^2}
	\right)
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the time step that we are at. The steps to solve this problem using the virtual boundary method can be defined as follows

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define the initial condition as $u^0$ and set $f^0$ equal to zero.
	\item Calculate the velocity at the next time step, $u^1$, using Equation \eqref{eq:C3_discretizedEquationPeskinIB}
	\item Map the velocity results to the Lagrangian nodes using the $\delta$ function
	\item Based on the new velocity at $t=1$ evaluate Equation \eqref{eq:C3_virtualBoundaryMethod}.
	\item Map the force at the Lagrangian location $X$ to its neighbouring Eulerian points using $\delta$ function.
	\item Reiterate until the convergence is satisfied.
\end{enumerate}

Comparing the virtual boundary method to the classical IB method, we can see that less steps are required for this formulation. Moreover, there is no need to solve the constitutive equation for the solid domain which reduces the total computational cost.

Like the classical IB method, we investigate the effect of mesh size, moving wall velocity, and values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ constants of the solution accuracy. The numerical results are verified with the analytical solution of this problem. We use the RMSE value as a metric to compare the results.

We looked at the effect of mesh size on the solution accuracy of the virtual boundary method. For this case, the moving wall velocity is fixed at $10 m/s$ with the location of fixed wall at $x_{wall} = 0.726$. The time step for this simulation is chosen as $10^{-5}$ with $\alpha = -1000$ and $\beta = -10$. We chose the node number as $11$, $41$, $81$, and $161$. The total length of the domain is chosen as $1 m$. As shown in Figure \ref{C3_virtualBoundaryResultNodeNumber} and Table \ref{table:C3_virtualBoundaryResultNodeNumberRMSE}, by increasing the nodes number the simulation results become more accurate. However, the convergence is reached earlier compared to the classical IB method of last section. This means that the computational effort to get the same accuracy compared to classical IB method is much less when using the virtual boundary method.

We looked at the effect of wall velocity of the solution accuracy. As before the length of the domain is fixed at $1 m$ with wall defined at $x_{wall} = 0.726$, the time step is chosen as $10^{-5}$. We chose the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ constants as $-1000$ and $-10$ respectively. We simulated the flow selecting the wall velocity as $10$, $100$, $1000$, and $10000$. The results are compared with the analytical results. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_virtualBoundaryResultWallVelocity} and Table \ref{table:C3_virtualBoundaryResultWallVelocityRMSE}, the wall velocity does not affect the accuracy of the solution. When compared with the results of the classical IB method in previous section, we can see that the virtual boundary method produces more accurate results. Moreover, the simulation time is much less than the classical IB method.

Finally we looked at the effect of constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the accuracy of the solution. We discretized the domain using $81$ nodes with wall velocity equal to $100$ with time step equal to $10^{-5}$. The location of the fixed wall is chosen as $x_{wall} = 0.726$. The flow between the plates is modelled using different coefficients for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as shown in Table \ref{table:C3_alphaBetaValues}.

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:C3_virtualBoundaryResultConstant} and Table \ref{fig:C3_virtualBoundaryResultConstantRSME}, $\alpha$ value has a considerable effect of the accuracy of the results. Increasing the $\alpha$ value with an order of magnitude results in a considerable improvement in the accuracy of the solution. However, $\beta$ value does not contribute to the accuracy but improves the stability of the solution. The solutions with larger $\beta$ values converged in less number of iterations.

\subsection{Penalization method}
The third class of continuum immersed boundary techniques are known as penalization method that was first introduced by Arquis and Caltagirone \cite{ arquis1984conditions}. In this method, the solid boundaries are modeled as porous media. Porosity or void fraction is a measure of the void spaces in a material, and is a fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume, between 0 and 1. For the solid domain the porosity value is near zero whereas for the fluid domain its value is close to one. Flow through a porous domain is described using the Darcy's law. This is a simple proportional relationship between the instantaneous discharge rate through a porous medium, the viscosity of the fluid and the pressure drop over a given distance.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14.cm]{Chapter_3/figure/Darcys_Law.png}
	\caption{Flow through a porous pipe.}
\end{figure}

For a flow through a porous domain in a pipe shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_darcyEquationPipe}, Darcy's law is written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_DarcysLaw}
	Q = \frac{\kappa A \Delta p}{\mu L}
\end{equation}

where $Q$ is the total flow discharge, $\kappa$ is the permeability of the domain, $\Delta p$ is the pressure drop due to the porosity between two ends of the pipe, $\mu$ is the fluid's viscosity, and $L$ is the length of the domain. Darcy's law can be considered as a relation between the flow velocity and pressure drop. This pressure drop  is used in the penalization method to represent the solid boundaries by modelling the force term using Equation \eqref{eq:C3_DarcysLaw}. The force term is defined as follows

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_forceTermIBpenelization}
	f = - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{X}) \frac{\mu}{\kappa} v
\end{equation}

where $v$ is is the velocity of the flow. In order to apply the force term only to the region inside the the solid boundary, the penalization force is multiplied by a Heaviside function, $\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{X})$, that is a function of relative distance of the points in the domain to the boundary of the solid region. The Heaviside function $\mathcal{H}$ has the value of \emph{one} for all points inside the solid boundary and is \emph{zero} for points outside the boundary. This will give us a zero forcing term for points outside the solid boundary and non-zero for points inside. Therefore, the pressure drop is only applied to the points inside the solid domain. This is explained in more details in the following example.

Assume that the solid boundary is a circle, located at $(1,2)$ with a radius of $2$. This curve is defined using the following equation.

\begin{equation}
	(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4
\end{equation}

The relative location of an arbitrary point $x_0 = (\eta, \rho)$ with respect to this boundary is defined using the following equation

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{X}(\eta, \rho) = 4 - (\eta - 1)^2 - (\rho - 2)^2
\end{equation}

Depending of the sign of $\mathcal{X}$, we can make the following conclusions

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
	\mathcal{X} > 0 \quad \text{$x_0$ is inside the solid boundary} \\
	\mathcal{X} < 0 \quad \text{$x_0$ is outside the solid boundary} \\
	\mathcal{X} = 0 \quad \text{$x_0$ is on the boundary}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Sign of $\mathcal{X}$ divides the physical domain into three regions. To use this function for force term assignment to mesh cell, we need to convent its values to $0$ and $1$. The force terms outside the solid boundaries are multiplied by zero whereas the force terms inside the solid boundary are multiplied by one. This is done by feeding the values of function $\mathcal{X}$ to a Heaviside function, $\mathcal{H}$. The Heaviside function, or the unit step function, is a discontinuous function whose value is zero for negative argument and one for positive argument as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_heavisideFunction}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14.cm]{Chapter_3/figure/Heaviside_Function.eps}
	\caption{The Heaviside function.}
	\label{{fig:C3_heavisideFunction}}
\end{figure}

By feeding the function $\mathcal{X}$ into the Heaviside function, we get the value of one for nodes inside the solid boundary and zero for outside. These are then multiplied to the force terms calculated using Equation \eqref{eq:C3_forceTermIBpenelization}. This enables us to apply the force term only within the solid domain. This method is applied to the demonstration problem of section \ref{sec:C3_benchmark_case}. For this problem, we looked at the effect of the number of mesh cells, wall velocity, and the permeability value on the accuracy of the method. The results are compared with analytical results for this problem like the previous sections.

For the first set of results, we looked at the effect of mesh size on the accuracy of the solution. The domain length is chosen as $1.0 m$ where the position of the fixed wall is selected as $0.6125$. We chose this so that the computational nodes won't coincide the with the wall location. This better represents the application of the IB method. We chose the node numbers as 11, 41, 81, and 161. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_penalizationResultNodeNumber}, as we increase the number of the total error between the numerical and analytical results decreases. For the Case where there is computational node exactly on top the location for the stationary wall ($n=161$), the two results match perfectly. The IB results are shown using solid line and the analytical results are represented using white circles.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering

	}
	\caption{Comparison between IB and analytical results for different number of nodes.}
	\label{fig:C3_penalizationResultNodeNumber}
\end{figure}

For the comparison between the IB and the analytical results we used the RSME value. These are shown in Table \ref{table:C3_penalizationResultNodeNumberRMSE}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
	Node number & RMSE value \\ \hline \hline
	11 & 0.0624 \\ \hline
	41 & 0.0139 \\ \hline
	81 & 0.005 \\ \hline
	161 & 0.001
\end{tabular}
\caption{RMSE value for different number of nodes}
\label{table:C3_penalizationResultNodeNumberRMSE}
\end{table}

As can be seen in Table \ref{table:C3_penalizationResultNodeNumberRMSE}, even for $n = 161$, the RMSE value is not zero. This is because in the penalization method, even for low values of porosity, there is still a small flow going through the solid domain.

For the next investigation, we look at the effect of the different velocity of moving wall on the accuracy of the penalization method. For this analysis we defined the fixed wall at $x=0.4325$ and discretized the domain using $81$ nodes. The inlet velocity is selected as $1$, $10$, $100$, and $1000$. To verify the methodology, we compared the IB with analytical results. We chose the time step as $10^{-5}$ and the porosity value as $\kappa = 10^{-5}$. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_penalizationResultInletVelocity} and the RMSE values in Table \ref{table:C3_penalizationResultInletVelocityRMSE}, the inlet velocity does not affect the the accuracy of the response. Moreover, all of these simulation are done using the same time step and porosity value.

	1000 & 0.0056
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Finally, we looked at the effect of different porosity values on the accuracy of the simulation. For this purpose, we fixed the wall location at $x_{wall} = 0.435$ and defined the velocity of the moving wall as $10 m/s$. The length of the domain is selected as $1 m$ and discretized using 81 nodes. We chose the time step as $10^{-5}$. We investigated the accuracy of penalization method to porosity values of $10^{-2}$, $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$, $10^{-5}$ by comparing the IB simulation with analytical results. The results shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3_penalizationResultPorosity} and Table \ref{table:C3_penalizationResultPorosityRMSE} shows the strong dependency of the simulation results of the porosity, $\kappa$, value. To select an appropriate porosity, several simulations need to be run and the convergence needs to be studied.

\label{table:C3_penalizationResultPorosityRMSE}
\end{table}

The penalization method is probably the easiest one in the continuous IB methods to implement however, its accuracy is very dependent on the number of nodes used. This is because there are no mechanisms to exactly define the location of solid boundaries in the penalization method. This can lead to loss of accuracy and oscillations near the boundaries. The porosity value, $\kappa$, needs to be selected by running multiple simulations are compare the results for convergence. Although even with low values of porosities, there is a leakage in the solid domain that reduces the accuracy of the simulations.
