\subsection{Pitch and Plunge Airfoil Motion}
Understanding the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of a pitching and plunging airfoil has two major engineering applications. First, it can be used to predict the dynamic stall of aerodynamic bodies such as aircraft in a demanding maneuver \cite{tuncer1998computational}. Dynamic stall is often seen in aerodynamic surfaces going through a pitching moment or oscillatory behavior. This phenomenon is caused due to instability and separation of the leading-edge vortex which results in a dramatic decrease in lift and sudden increase in pitching moment. Dynamic stall can lead to high amplitude vibrations and high loads that can cause fatigue and structural failure of the aerodynamic surfaces. The second motivation of investigating this unsteady aerodynamic behavior is the application of flapping wings for swimming and flying animals \cite{shyy2008computational}. The vast majority of research on the pitching and plunging airfoil is done by forcing the motion on the airfoil and looking at the aerodynamic response. This is mainly done for investigating the thrust and the parameters that control it \cite{tuncer2000computational, lian2008comparative}. Webb, et al. investigated the use of Immersed Boundary method for the forced pitching and plunging movement of the SD7003 airfoil and verified their solution with experimental results \cite{webb2008effects}. In this work, we are interested in the free oscillations of the airfoil due to aerodynamic loads. Moreover, we will investigate sensitivity of the airfoil displacement to its shape.

To have an analytical representation of the airfoil shape, we used the Joukowsky transform to define the geometry. Joukowsky transform is a conformal mapping that maps a circle in the complex plane to a shape that represents a typical airfoil shape. The Joukowsky transform is shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C5_joukowskyTransform}.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C5_joukowskyTransform}
	z = \zeta + \frac{1}{\zeta} \quad , \quad \zeta = x + iy
\end{equation}
%
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_joukowskyAirfoil}, the center location of the original circle defines the thickness and camber of the airfoil. For the sensitivity analysis, we are interested in the sensitivity of flow to the chamber; therefore, it is required to differentiate to the $y$ coordinate of circle center. This is calculated analytically.

The computational domain for this problem is defined as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_domainAirfoil}. The rigid airfoil is mounted on a two degree-of-freedom elastic structure as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilStructure}. The elastic structure contains an axial and torsional spring to represent an actual wing more accurately.

The governing equations for the elastic structure in the state-space form are shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C5_airfoilEquationOfMotion}.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C5_airfoilEquationOfMotion}
\begin{bmatrix}
	\dot{y} \\
	\ddot{y} \\
	\dot{\theta} \\
	\ddot{\theta}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\

	F \left( y, \dot{y}, t \right) \\
	0 \\
	M \left( \theta, \dot{\theta}, t \right)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
where $m$ is airfoil mass; $k$ is axial spring stiffness; $I$ is airfoil moment of inertia around its quarter-chord; $k_\theta$ is rotational spring stiffness; $F$ is the force in $y$ direction (lift generated by airfoil); and $M$ is the moment at quarter-chord. The force and moment are calculated using the pressure field from the solution of NS equations. Adams-bashforth method is used to explicitly integrate Equation \eqref{eq:C5_airfoilEquationOfMotion} in time.

For this problem, we look at two different airfoils mounted on the elastic structure as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilShape}. The difference in airfoil shape will result in different characteristics in the FSI response of the system. We refer to the airfoil defined in Figure \ref{fig:C5_thinAirfoil} as \emph{thin airfoil} and the one in Figure \ref{fig:C5_thickAirfoil} as \emph{thick airfoil}.

The Reynolds number for this simulation is selected as $100$. At higher Reynolds number will result in turbulent flow which is not considered in this research and therefore, the solution results for a higher Reynolds number does not represent a physical solution. For the elastic structure properties, spring stiffness is selected as $0.5 N/m$, airfoil mass as $1.0 Kg$, rotational spring as $0.1 N/\theta$, and the moment of inertia as $1.0 Kg \cdot m^2$. The results of the first 50-second simulation of the airfoil center location and change in the angle of attack due to aerodynamic loads are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilDisplacementRotation}. As shown here, the thin airfoil of Figure \ref{fig:C5_thinAirfoil} follows an oscillatory response whereas the thick airfoil of Figure \ref{fig:C5_thickAirfoil} experiences divergence.

To better understand the solution history, three snapshots from the u-velocity contour of the two airfoils are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_snapshotAirfoilSolution}. As shown here, the thick airfoil goes through large displacement and deformation. This is difficult to capture using the conventional body-conformal method; however, it can be done with rather ease by utilizing the current IB approach.

For the sensitivity analysis, we investigate the sensitivity of the airfoil displacement and rotation to change in its chamber. As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:shapeSenwithIB}, as a part of sensitivity calculation, it is required to derive the shape sensitivities. This is done analytically since the Joukowski transform provides us with an analytical definition for the airfoil boundary. The shape sensitivity of the airfoil to camber is calculated by differentiating Equation \eqref{eq:C5_joukowskyTransform} to the $y$ coordinate of the center of the airfoil. For the structure side, the shape only affects the loads acting on the elastic structure and not its shape. Therefore, we can use the same solver used for calculating the displacement and rotation of the structure for the sensitivity calculation. The time history of the sensitivity results for the displacement and rotation of the two airfoils is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilSensitivityTimeHistory}.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilSensitivityTimeHistory}, the sensitivity response flow is the same pattern as the analysis solution for this problem. For the oscillatory response of the thin airfoil, the sensitivity solution also moves between two extremes for both the displacement and airfoil rotation. However, for the thick airfoil that shows a divergence characteristic as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilDisplacementRotation}, the sensitivities also reach a constant value. It is interesting to see that for the thick airfoil, by increasing the thickness, the lift will increase and therefore, we see positive sensitivities for the displacement; however, the moment generated around the quarter chord decreases which causes a negative sensitivity for the rotation.

Finally, we looked at the u-velocity sensitivity contours as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C5_airfoilSensitivityContour} for different snapshots in time. As shown here, the velocity field around the airfoil in both cases contains the most sensitivity near the tip.
