\section{Shape Sensitivity of Flow Over a Cylinder}
% ==================================================
For the second demonstration problem, the flow over a cylinder is modeled via the virtual boundary method using Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithvirtualBoundaryIB} and the sensitivity of the flow field variables (velocity and pressure) with respect to the radius of the cylinder is calculated. For this problem, the domain is defined as a rectangle with the cylinder located on the horizontal symmetry line as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_cylinderPhysicalDomain}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Physical domain with dimensions for flow over cylinder.}
    \label{fig:C4_cylinderPhysicalDomain}
\end{figure}

The boundary conditions are defined as the flow velocity at the inlet (left boundary) and the outflow (zero gradient) boundary condition at the outlet (right boundary). The top and bottom boundaries are modeled as free slip walls. The surface of the cylinder is modeled by the virtual boundary method. The cylinder is located at $(0.5, 0.0)$ and has the radius of $0.1 m$. Its surface is represented by using 100 Lagrangian nodes. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values for this analysis are selected as $-10^4$ and $-50$. These constants are problem dependent and are selected in such a way that the required velocity conditions are satisfied at the Lagrangian points. To ensure the stability of the numerical method, the CFL number is kept under one for all following analysis. This is done by selected the appropriate time step for the chosen mesh size using Equation \eqref{eq:C4_CFLnumber}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_CFLnumber}
	\frac{u \Delta t}{\Delta x} + \frac{v \Delta t}{\Delta y} \leq 1.0
\end{equation}

The mesh convergence for this problem for Reynolds number of 100 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_meshConvergenceForCylidnerRE100GE}.

\end{figure}

The convergence study of the mesh refinement is also conducted for a node on the downwash of the cylinder at $(2, 0)$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_meshRefinementForCylinderRE100GE}. The slopes of the fitted lines to the u-velocity, v-velocity, and pressure error estimates are calculated as $-2.34$, and $-1.96$, and $-2.72$. This means that the method is second order in space and time.

To ensure that the zero velocity on the solid boundary, we looked at the value of the u and v velocities at the Lagrangian points on the boundary. These are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_fluidVelocityOnCylinder}. As shown here, the forcing terms brought the velocity to zero within the accuracy requirement. The oscillation of the velocity magnitude is due to their small values. The $\theta$ is the polar coordinate on Lagrangian points on the surface of the cylinder as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_cylinderPhysicalDomain}.

    \label{fig:C4_fluidVelocityOnCylinder}
\end{figure}

Finally, the pressure profile on the surface of the cylinder is calculated as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_pressureOnSurfaceCylinder}. No smoothing is done for the calculating the pressure values on the Lagrangian points. This data is interpolated using the RD function of Equation \eqref{eq:C4_deltaFunction}.

The continuum sensitivity equation are derived by differentiating the governing NS equations of \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithvirtualBoundaryIB} with respect to the shape design variable, $b$, as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithvirtualBoundaryIBsensitivity}. For this problem, the boundary oÿ® the cylinder is defined using the following analytical level-set function. For the points on the surface of the cylinder, Equation \eqref{eq:C4_levelSetFunctionForCylinder} is equal to zero.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_levelSetFunctionForCylinder}
	\mathcal{R}(x, y; r): (x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

For the sensitivity analysis, $\partial D/\partial X$ is calculated easily since the analytical form of the RD function is known (Equation \eqref{eq:C4_deltaFunction}). It is possible to calculate the $\partial X/\partial b$ values in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithvirtualBoundaryIBsensitivity} by differentiating Equation \eqref{eq:C4_levelSetFunctionForCylinder}. This is done in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_levelSetFunctionForCylinderSA}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_levelSetFunctionForCylinderSA}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{R}(x, y; r)}{\partial b}: 
	2 (x - x_0)\dfrac{\partial x}{\partial b} + 
	2 (y - y_0)\frac{\partial y}{\partial b} = 
	2 r \frac{\partial r}{\partial b}
\end{equation}

For this analysis, the design variable $b$ is selected as the radius of the cylinder. Therefore, the right-hand-side of Equation \eqref{eq:C4_levelSetFunctionForCylinderSA} reduces to $2r$.

The boundary conditions for the sensitivity analysis are defined by differentiating the original boundary conditions of the governing equations. These conditions do not depend on the design variables and therefore, have zero values. Having the governing equations and boundary conditions, it is possible to solve the sensitivity equations. The convergence analysis for the sensitivity results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_flowOverCylinderSAmeshConvergence}. As can be seen in these plots, the mesh size of $500 \time 375$ is selected for the rest of sensitivity analysis.

The complex step method is used to validate the sensitivity response of the system. As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:introduction}, the complex step method does not have the accuracy issues of the finite different method and provides the accurate sensitivities up to machine precision. However, the analysis code requires handling complex arithmetic. The analysis code is developed in MATLAB using the guidelines of \cite{martins2003complex} so that complex step can be used to calculating the sensitivities. The complex-step derivative is defined in Equation \eqref{eq:C1_compelxStepFormula}. The comparison of the CSA results with the complex step solution for the sensitivities for a different location in the domain is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_flowOverCylinderSensitivityValidation}. The RMSE value is used to compare the results of continuum sensitivity analysis (CSA) and complex step (CS) method. Figure \ref{fig:C4_flowOverCylinderSensitivityValidation}, shows a good comparison between the CSA and CS results.

The rate of convergence of the sensitivity results are investigated in Figure \ref{fig:C4_flowOverCylinderSArateOfConvergence}. The slope of the fitted line (dashed line) for $u$-velocity, $v$-velocity, and pressure sensitivity is reported as $-2.2$, $-1.94$, and $-2.31$. The $v$-velocity has lower convergence rate since the sampling location is near the wall when the spatial approximations are first order.

In most aerodynamic/aeroelastic designs, the sensitivity analysis is conducted for calculating the sensitivity of the pressure field on the surface of the solid boundaries. This sensitivity value is later used for calculating the sensitivity of aerodynamic forces acting on the solid boundaries by integrating the sensitivity of the pressure field. For this purpose, the sensitivity of pressure field is plotted on solid boundaries and verified with the complex step method in Figure \ref{fig:C4_flowOverCylidner_pressureSensitivityOnSurface}. It should be noted that Savitzky-Golay filtering is used to smooth the results over the solid boundary. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_flowOverCylidner_pressureSensitivityOnSurface}, the two results agree very well with each other.
