\section{Shape Sensitivity of Flow over a Cylinder}
% ==================================================
For the second demonstration problem, the flow over a cylinder is modeled using the virtual boundary method using Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithvirtualBoundaryIB}. The sensitivity analysis is conducted by differentiating the NS equations as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithvirtualBoundaryIBsensitivity}. For this problem the domain is defined as a rectangle with the cylinder located on the horizontal symmetry line as shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_cylinderPhysicalDomain}.
