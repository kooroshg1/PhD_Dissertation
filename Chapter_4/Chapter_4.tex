\chapter{Shape Sensitivity Analysis using Immersed Boundary Method}
In this chapter we apply the continuum sensitivity analysis to the CFD simulations conducted using the Immersed Boundary (IB) method. In this chapter the focus is on calculating the sensitivity of flow variables such as pressure and velocity to the design variable that controls the shape of the boundary, i.e. radius of a cylinder, camber of an airfoil. The boundary of the solid domain is represented using an analytical function. However, as will be shown in the following chapters this is not a required for this method. In this chapter the modifications on the IB approach to make it suitable for continuum sensitivity formulation is discussed. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first time that sensitivity analysis is done for CFD simulations based the continuum IB formulation.

\section{Sensitivity Problem Formulation}
In contrast to traditional body conformal methods, in IB approach the solid boundaries are represented by modifying the governing equation near the boundaries. In the case of continuum IB method, this is done by adding the appropriate force term to the cells adjacent to the immersed boundary. The value of these forces are calculated either using a feedback forcing \cite{goldstein1993modeling} or a penalization function \cite{arquis1984conditions}. The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are written as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NS}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_NS}
	\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = 
	-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho} + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $P$ is pressure, $\mu$ is the kinematic viscosity ($\mu / \rho$), $\rho$ is density, and $\mathbf{f}$ is the forcing term. The NS equations are solved on a Eulerian grid that is fixed in space and the IB is defined on a separate Lagrangian grid that can move. This is shown Figure \ref{fig:C4_lagrangianAndEulerianDomain}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=7.00cm]{Chapter_4/figure/lagrangian_and_eulerian_nodes.jpg}
	\caption{Eulerian and Lagrangian nodes for representing the fluid and solid domain. The Eulerian and Lagrangian nodes are represented by black squares and red circles.}
	\label{fig:C4_lagrangianAndEulerianDomain}
\end{figure}

The forcing function in the penalization method is calculated at the \emph{Eulerian} nodes and is applied to computational nodes inside the solid boundary using a step function as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_penalizationForcingFunction}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_penalizationForcingFunction}
	\mathbf{f} = -\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{X}(b)) \kappa \mathbf{u}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{S}$ is the step function, $\mathcal{X}$ defines the relative location of locations inside the domain with respect to the IB boundary, $\kappa$ is the penalization parameter, and $\mathbf{u}$ is the fluid velocity. Using this forcing function, the governing equation \eqref{eq:C4_NS} is rewritten as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithPenalization}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_NSwithPenalization}
	\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = 
	-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho} + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} -\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{X}(b)) \kappa \mathbf{u}
\end{equation}

As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:sensitivityAnalysis}, to derive the continuum sensitivity formulation the governing equation of \eqref{eq:C4_NSwithPenalization} is differentiated with respect to the design variable, $b$. The step function $\mathcal{S}$ derivative is Dirac delta function with is singular and cannot be used to solving the governing equations in a numerical framework. Therefore a regularized Heaviside function, $\mathcal{H}$ will be employed instead of the step function for penalizing the governing equation. The effect of this function of the simulation results and sensitivity formulation will be discussed in the following sections.

In the virtual boundary method, the forcing function is calculated at the \emph{Lagrangian} nodes using Equation \eqref{eq:C3_feedbackForcingFunction}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C3_feedbackForcingFunction}
	\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{X}, t) = 
	\alpha \int_0^t \left[ \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}, \tau) - \mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, \tau) \right] d\tau + 
	\beta \left[ \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}, \tau) - \mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, \tau) \right]
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}, t)$ is the fluid's velocity at the Lagrangian points $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, t)$ is the desired velocity at the Lagrangian point. For the no-slip boundary condition at the solid boundary, the desired velocity $\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, t)$ is zero at each of the Lagrangian points. The Eulerian nodes where the fluid's governing equation is solved does not necessary coincide with the Lagrangian points. Moreover, the forcing functions that are evaluated at the Lagrangian nodes need to tranfered to the Eulerian nodes where the governing equations for the fluid is solved. As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:immersedBoundary}, different mapping functions are used for transferring data between the Lagrangian and Eulerian nodes. However, none of these functions are continuously differentiable as required for the continuum sensitivity analysis. To address this issue a regularized delta function is introduced.

\subsection{Regularized Heaviside/Delta Function}
The Regularized Heaviside (RH) function is a step function that is smoothed so that its derivative can be calculated numerically. The RH function is also known as sigmoid function in mathematics and is characterized as a real-valued and differentiable, having either a non-negative or non-positive first derivative. There are a pair of horizontal asymptotes as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$. The RH function is used instead of the step function to penalized the governing equation.  Several different RH functions defined in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_regularizedHeavisideFunctionFormulas} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionExample}.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C4_regularizedHeavisideFunctionFormulas}
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{H}_1 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\pi} \arctan \left( x \right) \\
	\mathcal{H}_2 &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2x}} \\
	\mathcal{H}_3 &= e^{-e^{-x}} \\
	\mathcal{H}_4 &= \frac{1 + \tanh(x / 4)}{2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12.00cm]{Chapter_4/figure/heaviside_function_example.eps}
	\caption{Comparison between different regularized Heaviside functions ($\mathcal{H}_i$) and step function ($\mathcal{S}$).}
	\label{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionExample}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionExample}, all the RH functions are symmetric around $x = 0$ other than $\mathcal{H}_3$. This symmetry is required since the line $x = 0$ defines the boundary of the solid domain and NS equations are penalized based on the location of this boundary. In this work, the RH function is selected as $\mathcal{H}_2 = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-2x}}$ since it gives the fastest transition from $0$ to $1$. This transition is further controlled by adding the control parameter $\eta$ to the RH function definition as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_heavisideFunction}. The effect of control parameter on the RH function is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionWithControlParamter}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionWithControlParamter} the transition region is reduced by increasing the control parameter. Using this feature, the smearing effect of penalization method can be reduced near the boundaries.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_heavisideFunction}
	\mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x / \eta}}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12.00cm]{Chapter_4/figure/heaviside_function_with_control.eps}
	\caption{Effect of control parameter $\eta$ on the RH function.}
	\label{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionWithControlParamter}
\end{figure}

The penalized NS equation using the RH function of Equation \eqref{fig:C4_heavisideFunctionExample} is continuous and can be differentiated to derive the continuum sensitivity equations.

For IB simulations incorporating the virtual boundary method, the Regularized Delta (RD) function is a substitute used for transferring data between the Lagrangian and Eulerian nodes. In mathematics, the Dirac delta function is defined as the derivative of the unit step function. To be consistant with the mathematical formulation, the RD function is calculated by differentiating the RH functions of Equation \eqref{eq:C4_regularizedHeavisideFunctionFormulas} as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_regularizedDeltaFunctionFormulas}. These RD functions are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:C4_deltaFunctionExample}.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:C4_regularizedDeltaFunctionFormulas}
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{D}_1 &= \frac{1}{\pi \left(x^{2} + 1\right)} \\
	\mathcal{D}_2 &= \frac{2 e^{- 2 x}}{\left(e^{- 2 x} + 1\right)^{2}} \\
	\mathcal{D}_3 &= \frac{e^{- x}}{e^{e^{- x}}} \\
	\mathcal{D}_4 &= - 0.125 \tanh^{2}{\left (\frac{x}{4} \right )} + 0.125
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12.00cm]{Chapter_4/figure/delta_function_example.eps}
	\caption{Comparison between different regularized delta functions ($\mathcal{D}_i$). The integral of all these functions over $x\in(-\infty, \infty)$ is equal to one.}
	\label{fig:C4_deltaFunctionExample}
\end{figure}

In this work, the RD function $\mathcal{D}_2$ is selected for implimentation in the virtual boundary method. The sharpness of this RD function is further controlled by using the $\eta$ function as used in the definition of the corresponding RH function. This is defined in Equation \eqref{eq:C4_deltaFunction}. The RD function for different value for $\eta$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_deltaFunctionWithControlParamter}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C4_heavisideFunction}
	\mathcal{D} = \frac{e^{- \dfrac{x}{\eta}}}{t \left(1 + e^{- \dfrac{x}{\eta}}\right)^{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12.00cm]{Chapter_4/figure/delta_function_with_control.eps}
	\caption{Effect of control parameter $\eta$ on the RD function.}
	\label{fig:C4_deltaFunctionWithControlParamter}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:C4_deltaFunctionWithControlParamter}, the RD function has continuous derivatives. This enables the use of virtual boundary method to be used as a part continuum sensitivity analysis for sensitivity calculation through providing differentiable governing equations.
